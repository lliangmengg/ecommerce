# UNCLO E-Commerce Platform

## Introduction

UNCLO is a demo e-commerce platform developed to showcase the integration of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in full-stack development. While it includes key functionalities such as user authentication, product management, and cart operations, it is still a work in progress with some features missing.

## Key Features

- **MERN Stack Implementation:** Demonstrates the use of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js for building a full-stack application.

- **Frontend Development:**
  - **Dynamic React Components:** Features interactive and reusable UI components.
  - **React Context API:** Used for managing global state across components.
  - **Real-Time Updates:** Implemented where applicable, though not fully integrated in the demo.

- **Backend Development:**
  - **RESTful APIs:** Created with Express.js for handling user authentication, product management (CRUD operations), and cart management.
  - **Secure Authentication:** Uses JWT-based authentication and bcrypt for password hashing.
  - **Modular Architecture:** Organized backend code into modular components, enhancing the projectâ€™s scalability and ease of extension. This structure includes separate directories for controllers, models, routes, and middleware, which allows for straightforward addition of new features and maintenance of existing ones.

- **Database Integration:**
  - **MongoDB with Mongoose:** Manages schemas for efficient data handling.
  - **Image Upload Handling:** Utilizes multer for handling image uploads.
