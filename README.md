# UNCLO E-Commerce Platform

## Introduction

UNCLO is a demo e-commerce platform developed to showcase the integration of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in full-stack development.

## Key Features

- **Frontend Development:**
  - **Dynamic React Components:** Features interactive and reusable UI components.
